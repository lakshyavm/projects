  Program finished. Press Enter to close this window.
  ```
  Press Enter to close or review the output before exiting.

## Example Usage

```
Enter number of students: 2
Enter student name: Alice

## How to Build the EXE Yourself (Optional)

1. Install PyInstaller with:
   ```
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
2. Generate the executable:
   ```
   python -m pyinstaller --onefile marks.py
   ```
3. Your `.exe` file will be found in the `dist` directory.

## Notes

- Enter numeric values only for marks.
- The console program will not close until you press Enter, so you have time to review the output.
